# Folder Poetry

> Folder Poetry is the practice of using the structure of computer folder
> organization as a new kind of poetic form like haiku or iambic pentameter. By
> naming and nesting folders and files, we can create unfolding narratives,
> rhythmic prose, and choose-your-own-adventure poetry.
